/*! \file blackhole_local.h
 *  \brief comm structures to be used throughout blackhole routines
 */
/*
 * This file is largely written by Phil Hopkins (phopkins@caltech.edu) for GIZMO.
 *   It was based on a similar file in GADGET3 by Volker Springel (volker.springel@h-its.org),
 *   but the physical modules for black hole accretion and feedback have been
 *   replaced, and the algorithm for their coupling is new to GIZMO.  This file was modified
 *   on 1/9/15 by Paul Torrey (ptorrey@mit.edu) for clarity by parsing the existing code into
 *   smaller files and routines. Some communication and black hole structures were modified
 *   to reduce memory usage. Cleanup, de-bugging, and consolidation of routines by Xiangcheng Ma
 *   (xchma@caltech.edu) followed on 05/15/15; re-integrated by PFH.
