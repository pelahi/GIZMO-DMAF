Different methods:
* Method 1 (activate using DMANNIHILATION): DMAF AT GAS
  - DM density is calculated at each gas particle using smoothing length HsmlDM
  - from DM density, DM annihilation rate at gas particle is calculated
  - energy injection at each gas particle
Files used in folder DMAF: 
  - dm_annihilation.c for calculatation of DM density at gas particles

* Method 2 (activate using DMANNIHILATION_DM, file dm_fb.c): DMAF AT DM
  - gas density is calculated at each DM particle
  - DM annihilation rate at DM particle is calculated
  - energy is injected into surrounding gas particles
Files used in folder DMAF: 
  - dm_annihilation.c for calculation of DM density at DM particles
  - dm_rho_gas.c for calculation of gas density at DM particles
  - dm_fb.c for calculation of energy injection at each DM particle into surrounding gas particles
