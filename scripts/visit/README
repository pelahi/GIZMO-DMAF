GIZMO HDF5 VisIt Plugin
-----------------------

This is a VisIt plugin for importing GIZMO HDF5 snapshot files into VisIt.


- DEPENDENCIES -

This plugin was created/tested using

* cmake  2.8.8  works for me
* HDF5   1.8.11 works for me
* VisIt  2.7.1  works for me

Other versions might work as well.



- INSTALL -

To install, first create a CMakeLists.txt file using the xml2cmake utility
bundled with VisIt

$ xml2cmake -clobber ZelmaniTracers.xml

Create a build folder for cmake, i.e., from the visit plugin directory:

$ mkdir build

Change into the build directory

$ cd build

Run cmake

$ cmake ..

If successful this should have generated a Makefile. To compile/install do:

$ make

This will install the plugin to

${HOME}/.visit/${VISIT_VERSION}/${VISIT_ARCH}/plugins



- INDEX FILE -

This is a STSD (Single Time Single Domain) plugin. This means that the plugin,
by itself, is only able to read a single snapshot file. To deal with chunked
output and/or with multiple times, you need to create a VisIt index file. This
should be an ASCII file with extension ``.visit'' having the following format
(with no indentation):

  !NBLOCKS 2
  snapshot.000.0.hdf5
  snapshot.000.1.hdf5
  snapshot.001.0.hdf5
  snapshot.001.1.hdf5
  ...

The ``NBLOCKS'' field specifies the number of chunks of the data (number of
files for each iteration). This is followed by the list of all of the files for
the first iteration, followed by the ones for the second iteration and so on
and so forth. VisIt is able to read this file and figure out how to combine the
different HDF5 files.

You can create an index file using the script ``make_visit_index.sh'' contained
in this directory, as follows

$ /bin/bash ./make_visit_index.sh ${nchunks} ${list_of_snapshots}

For example, to create an index file for an unchunked run out of all of the
HDF5 files, one can do

$ /bin/bash ./make_visit_index.sh 1 *.hdf5 > snapshot.visit 



- CURRENT STATUS -

This plugin is still EXPERIMENTAL. I would not be surprised if it fails to read
your data.
